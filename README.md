# Work-Day-Scheduler-HW

## Description:

## I created wrok day scheduler application runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. In the application, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar and I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours for that day. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
